My personal portfolio website built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion

## Roadmap

### Log (September 20, 2024)

Originally, this website was made with the naive assumption that doing everything from scratch was better. I refused to use packages and libraries unless they were part of React itself or purely Javascript code. This was coming from an engineering perspective where I thought having minute and customized control over all the details would yield better results. Turns out I have been shooting myself in the foot and losing out on so much productivity, which is essential if you want to be competitive in this blazingly fast software industry.

I jumped headfirst into an internship just knowing the basics (HTML, CSS, and Javascript). However, in the past few months of my internship, I've picked up on some helpful workflows and libraries. With this branch, I'm going to revamp my portfolio website with the following:

- [-] Migrate to Typescript for that juicy type safety
- [-] Migrate to Tailwind (I was insane to do this with pure CSS)
- [-] Use a UI library (preferably shadcn)
- [-] Consider using NextJs (will have to decide on what other pages I would need)
- [ ] Improve resume part like create a reusable component I can do so I can just customize it on the fly
- [ ] Try to implement Framer motion on some of these animations (will not mess with pure CSS again that was a pain)
- [ ] Find a way to create a CD setup
- [-] Upload .env to github =)
